# PyTorch LAttice-based Speech Transducer (LAST)

The LAttice-based Speech Transducer (LAST) is a PyTorch library for building
lattice-based speech transducer models, such as
[GNAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13674). There is also a 
[JAX-based implmentation](https://github.com/google-research/last) of 
the repository for those interested.
